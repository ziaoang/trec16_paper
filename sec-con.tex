\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present our systems for TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization Track.
In the push notification scenario,
we pay main attention on designing a online system
for handling the real-time Twitter sample stream
and make proper push actions for each interest profile.
In the email digest scenario,
We apply web-based query expansion using language model to rank candidate tweets and
then we leverage two kinds of strategies to measure novelty between tweets.
Experimental results show our effectiveness and efficiency of our system in both tasks.
